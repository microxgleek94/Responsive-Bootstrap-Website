                                <br><br> Hello everyone! My name is Keiana Hanson, but a lot of people just call me "Kiki." I just
                                turned 26, live on Long Island in New York and I am a beginner coder/developer.
                                In 2016, I graduated from Binghamton University with my Bachelor of Arts with a major in
                                Creative Writing and a minor in Cinema. As a child, I’ve always been creative – from writing
                                “fanfictions” about my favorite characters from movies and shows, to creating ridiculous
                                skits and short movies with my college acapella group, I’ve always wanted to be creative for
                                a living.<br><br>
                                <br><br> When I graduated from college, I really wanted to express my creativity as a video editor. I
                                even had an externship through Binghamton with Showtime Network in Los Angele, California,
                                and for a week I was able to speak with executives, assistants, and interns from California
                                universities; I got to review unreleased content and scripts, sit in on meetings and truly
                                see how the network operated from an administrational standpoint. (Note: an externship is
                                like an internship, but you don’t have to do any “homework,” or have responsibilities, so
                                you are free to truly immerse yourself in the experience).<br><br>
                                <br><br>That summer, I applied to countless PA (production assistant) positions, both locally and
                                nationally, but to my dismay, many of them advised me because I of my lack of experience and
                                exposure in the television industry, they could not offer me a job.br><br>
                                Fast forward four years, and presently, I want to present my creativity in the medium of
                                video games. I enrolled in Columbia University’s Coding Booth Camp so I may develop the
                                skill set to become a software developer and bring my ideas to light.
                                <br><br> This post-grad journey has been confusing and I’ve had many moments where I felt lost, but I
                                am forever grateful for the journey nonetheless, as it has led me to this point in my life
                                and I’m excited to see where I end up.<br><br>
